# 10 Object-Oriented Programming: Team Profile Generator

## Description

The primary focus of this unit was to build an application using the Node.js command-line that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team and, to generates an HTML webpage that displays the user input data. One requirement of the application was to make use of Constructors and Classes to create the employee objects. Among these were the Employee, Manager, Engineer, and Intern classes. In addition to building the application, this project also required the use of Jest and Inquirer to conduct unit tests of every part of the code to ensure that it would pass each test that will be demonstarted below.

## Installation

This application uses [Jest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest) for running the unit tests and [Inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer/v/8.2.4) for collecting input from the user. The application will be invoked by using the following command:

```bash
node index.js
```
